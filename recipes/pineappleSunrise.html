    <li>Cook's Notes:</li>
    <li>
      One pound of carrots is about 6 to 7 medium carrots. Once juiced, it
      makes about 8 ounces of juice.
    </li>
    <li>
      Two cups of fresh pineapple is about 1/3 of a fresh pineapple and makes
      about 8 ounces of juice; there is no need to core it.
    </li>
    <li>
      Use only 1/2 the lime if you prefer the juice less tart; there is no
      need to peel it.
    </li>
  </ul>
